created a ASP.NET Web Application for the conference being organized by ContosoConf consists of a number of sessions that are organized into tracks. A track groups sessions of related technologies, and conference attendees can view the sessions in a track to determine which ones may be of most interest to them. To assist conference attendees, i added a Schedule page that lists the tracks and sessions for the conference to the ContosoConf website. The delegates who want to attend ContosoConf will need to register and provide their details. 
In addition, the conference organizers asked whether it was possible for conference attendees to be able to indicate which sessions they would like to attend. This will enable the conference organizers to schedule popular sessions in larger rooms. The Schedule page has been enhanced to display star icons next to each session. An attendee can click a star icon to register their interest in that session. This information must be recorded in a database on the server and you send this information to another web service that updates the corresponding data in the database.
